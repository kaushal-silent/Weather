Implement Weather modeling using the quadratic solution in stages: hard-coding, variable keyboard, read from a file, for a single set of input, multiple set of inputs.
implement the model in stages as mentioned:
a)Hard-coding variable: Start with predefined values for the coefficient and other parameter.
b)Keyboard input: Allows user input for coefficient and parameters.
c)Reading from a file(single input): Read the coefficient and parameters from a file for a single set of input values.
d)Reading from a file(multiple inputs): Extend the file reading to handle multiple set of inputs values.
temperature = a*time**2+b*2+c
